# Unit 20 - "Looks like we've made our First Contract!"

## Background

Your new startup has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

Fortunately, you've been learning how to program smart contracts with Solidity! What you will be doing this assignment is creating 2 `ProfitSplitter` contracts. These contracts will do several things:

* Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.

* Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.

## Files

* [`AssociateProfitSplitter.sol`](Starter-Code/AssociateProfitSplitter.sol) -- Level 1 starter code.

* [`TieredProfitSplitter.sol`](Starter-Code/TieredProfitSplitter.sol) -- Level 2 starter code.



## Instructions

This assignment has two levels of difficulty, with each contract increasing in complexity and capability. Although it is highly recommended you complete all two contracts, you are only required to solve one of the two contracts. Recommended to start with Level 1, then move forward as you complete the challenges. You can build them both with the skills you already have!

* **Level One** is an `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract. This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

* **Level Two** is a `TieredProfitSplitter` that will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.
